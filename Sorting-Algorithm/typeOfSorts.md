1. Bubble Sort :-
- >Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by comparing the adjacent elements in the list and swapping them if the elements are not in the specified order. It is an in-place and stable sorting algorithm that can sort items in data structures such as arrays and linked lists.

2. Merge Sort :-
- >Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then it merges the two sorted halves. The merge() function is used for merging two halves.

3. Quick Sort :-
- >The key process in quickSort is a partition(). The target of partitions is to place the pivot (any element can be chosen to be a pivot) at its correct position in the sorted array and put all smaller elements to the left of the pivot, and all greater elements to the right of the pivot.

4. Insertion Sort :-
- >The basic idea behind the algorithm is to divide the list into two parts: a sorted part and an unsorted part. The algorithm then iterates through each element in the unsorted part, picking one at a time, and inserts it into its correct position in the sorted part.

5. Selection Sort :-
- >Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list.
