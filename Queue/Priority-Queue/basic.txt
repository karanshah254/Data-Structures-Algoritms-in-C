1. A queue in which we are able to insert & remove items from any position based on some
property (such as priority of the task to be processed) is often referred as priority queue.

2. Priorities are attached with each Job
    2.1 - Priority 1 -> Real Time Job

    2.2 - Priority 2 -> Online Job

    2.3 - Priority 3 -> Batch Processing Job

3. Therefore if a job is initiated with priority i, it is inserted immediately at the end of list of
other jobs with priorities i.

4. Here jobs are always removed from the front of queue.

5. P.Q -> viewed as set of queues

    R1 R2 … Ri-1 -> Real Time Job
    O1 O2 … Oj-1 -> Online job
    B1 B2 … Bk-1 -> Batch Processing Job
